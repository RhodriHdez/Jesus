      <td colspan="4">Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Jesus Christ, is a central figure in Christianity and a significant historical and cultural figure worldwide. He was a Jewish teacher and healer who lived in the first century CE in Roman-occupied Judea. The New Testament describes him as a preacher who emphasized love, forgiveness, compassion, and the coming of the &ldquo;Kingdom of God.&rdquo; He became known for his parables and reported miracles, attracting followers and challenging religious and social norms of the time. Jesus was eventually crucified under the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, an event Christians interpret as a sacrificial act for humanity&rsquo;s salvation. His life and teachings have profoundly shaped Western civilization and continue to influence billions of people across cultures and religions.</td>

      <td colspan="4">Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem and raised in the Galilean town of Nazareth, where he likely learned carpentry, a trade associated with his family. He lived during a period of social tension between Jewish communities and Roman authorities, which shaped much of the religious climate of his time. Although little is documented about his early life, his public ministry—beginning around age 30—was marked by itinerant teaching, gathering disciples, and engaging in debates with religious leaders. His message often focused on inner moral transformation rather than strict adherence to ritual law. After his crucifixion, his followers claimed he rose from the dead, an event that became the foundation of Christian faith. Within decades, belief in Jesus spread throughout the Mediterranean world, contributing to the development of one of history&rsquo;s largest and most influential religions.</td>
