      <td colspan="4"><p data-start="117" data-end="909">Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Jesus Christ, is recognized as the central figure of Christianity and one of the most influential individuals in human history. He was a Jewish teacher who lived in the first century CE in the region of Judea, which at the time was under Roman rule. According to the New Testament, he was born in Bethlehem to Mary, whom Christians believe conceived him through a miraculous event, and he grew up in the small town of Nazareth. While the Gospels provide only limited details about his early life, they portray him as a child with exceptional spiritual awareness and wisdom. His upbringing in a modest, rural environment shaped his understanding of everyday life, poverty, and the struggles of common people—all themes that would later appear in his teachings.</p>
      <p data-start="911" data-end="1855">Jesus began his public ministry around the age of thirty, following his baptism by John the Baptist, a well-known prophet who preached repentance. After this event, Jesus traveled across Galilee, Judea, and surrounding regions, delivering a message centered on the &ldquo;Kingdom of God.&rdquo; He taught that this kingdom was both a present spiritual reality and a future hope, calling people to turn their hearts toward God and live with compassion and integrity. He frequently taught through parables—short stories with moral or spiritual lessons—making his message accessible to ordinary listeners. Jesus also became known for performing healings and other acts his followers viewed as miracles, which drew large crowds and strengthened the belief that he was sent by God. Throughout this period, he gathered a group of loyal disciples, including the Twelve Apostles, who accompanied him closely and later became key figures in spreading his teachings.</p></td>

      <td colspan="4"><p data-start="1857" data-end="2652">The core of Jesus&rsquo;s teachings emphasized love, mercy, forgiveness, and humility. He urged people to love God wholeheartedly and to treat others with kindness, even those considered enemies. Jesus also challenged social and religious norms of his time, calling for sincerity in faith rather than strict adherence to ritual, and he spoke out against hypocrisy among certain religious leaders. His messages about justice, caring for the poor, and uplifting the marginalized resonated with many people but also caused tension with influential groups. Despite increasing criticism from leaders who saw him as a threat to their authority or social order, Jesus continued to preach openly, attracting followers from all backgrounds, including fishermen, tax collectors, women, and the socially outcast.</p>
      <p data-start="2654" data-end="3665">Eventually, Jesus&rsquo;s growing influence and his dramatic entrance into Jerusalem during the Passover festival led to heightened political and religious tensions. He was arrested, accused of blasphemy and of posing a challenge to Roman stability, and brought before the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate. Although Pilate&rsquo;s exact motives are debated by historians, he ultimately authorized Jesus&rsquo;s crucifixion, a common Roman method of execution reserved for criminals and dissenters. Jesus died on the cross and was placed in a tomb, but according to Christian belief, he rose from the dead three days later—a defining event known as the Resurrection. This event inspired profound faith in his followers, who believed he had conquered death and confirmed his divine mission. Motivated by their experiences and convictions, his disciples spread his teachings far beyond Judea, laying the foundation for Christianity, a religion that would shape global history, culture, philosophy, ethics, and art for centuries to come</p></td>
